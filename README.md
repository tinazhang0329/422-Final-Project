# Liver Disease Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting liver disease using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of patient records with various medical attributes, and the goal is to classify whether a patient has liver disease or not. The project explores different machine learning models, including:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)
- Random Forest

## Dataset
- **Liver Patient Dataset (LPD)_train.csv**: Raw dataset containing patient records.
- **cleaned_liver_disease_data.csv**: Preprocessed dataset with missing values handled and feature engineering applied.
- **df_scaled.csv**: Normalized dataset for improved model performance.
- **test.csv.xlsx**: Test dataset used for model evaluation.
